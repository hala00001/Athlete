"Good way to embarrass yourself and the country, great job",1
"A total stunt, he can lift 285kg but couldn't defeat women here, just so they can ""confirm"" trangenders don't have advantage against women.",1
So a man fails in women’s competition,1
"Well of course he's gonna make history. No man has ever faced a woman in the Olympics! Not just history, making a mockery of the Olympics",1
She should try testosterone.,1
All jerk and no snatch,1
"Wait till the next Sumner Olympics or the WWO more fittingly, the flood gates will be open especially in track and field. I feel sorry for your DNA born daughters. ",1
"Keep encouraging madness. His skeletal structure, muscle development are all male. Even if he has sexual reassignment surgery. You believe you are a woman no problem, you want to dress as a woman go right ahead but being allowed to compete as a woman is wrong. The women who have trained, some of them their whole lives to compete at this level don't deserve to be treated in this manner. It is not fair nor equitable to them.",1
"Is Laurel taking estrogen? Is Laurel's testosterone under the correct limits for women? Sorry if this sounds really crappy of me, but honestly I wonder if this is a joke. Is Laurel taking on women's attire since the Olympics is so dead set on having strict uniform codes for women?How is that one woman doing who was disqualified because her testosterone was naturally too high simply because she was intersexed?",1
His new goal is to enter the children competition. ,1
Hormone therapy is way more dangerous than marijuana…,1
It's a false medal because phisically he is a man and only emotionaly is a woman. It's not fair for the rest of women liftweghter.,1
At least he did not win. Couldn't beat men now he tried to beat women... And still lost. Give it up man.,1
That’s just a dude with a pony tail isn’t it? Had to read the caption for the first time ever.,1
he would be a really noteworthy First Lady beside the Second Gentleman 😮 isn't it true?,1
"Hmmm he failed to compete as a man n failed to to make an impact as a woman ,i guess the ship sunk so low that anybody now makes history .",1
What's next? Going to break a leg to qualify for the paralympics?,1
Body of men with women mentality ? Its not fair to compete with real women..,1
So it's a beta male competing against woman because he is to weak to compete against men.,1
That’s a Larry not Laurel…the worlds gone mad ,1
Good for her!! Its really nice the Olympics are accepting people who go through a transformation! ,0
"It seems absurd that people get so emotionally invested in events that only happen once every four years and have literally no bearing on their lives whatsoever. Get out and do something useful, folks.",0
"Who cares, it's a sport not anything that contributes to every day life. Just be happy for everyone we dont have to agree but we should respect everyone.",0
"I’m all for equality and all…. So let’s just make a third group for the olympics. So there will be : Males, Females, and trans/non-binary group. Aka trans get their own group and compete against other trans members only",0
As long as he/she feels good about them selves is all that matters. I think he/she should still get a participation medal.,0
For what? Doing D!ck ups?,1
"And here we neglect to ""follow the science""",0
Pioneer??? Cheater is more like it ,1
Ya. This isn't a source for NEWS anymore. Don't watch it anymore. Changed channel.,0
In other words it's a sad day for the Olympics ,0
The comments are awfully thick of transphobia and ignorance today,0
Congrats to them!!! Make history: be your self and be proud. No one should tell you what you can or can't do: ,0
Disgusting...Female athletes will never have a fair chance against that ,1
"Males against males, females against females, so tell me again what is wrong with that idea.",0
"ABC13, are you seriously applauding this?? this is absurd and absolutely unfair",1
I accidentally watched about 10 minutes of golf,0
WOW!!!! This thing is getting ratio'ed BIG TIME!! I guess the masses have chosen...,0
"I absolutely will not watch anything. Between this thief stealing the gold from the women and the women’s soccer team being a disgrace to our country, what’s the point. ",1
"You said it, it’s history!!!!👎",0
All sports should make a requirement that you compete as who you are genetically.,0
