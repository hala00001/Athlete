Did we forget what real heroes look like? Where is the face of the girl who didn’t quit and won Gold ,1
She should smoke some weed to calm her mind and be mentality relaxed with all the weight of the world on her shoulders.,1
We are missing a lot about other Olympic athletes/players enough of the Simone stuffs,1
She should have stayed home,1
Just sent her home!! She is scared as hell to compete,1
This is Olympic not Simone game,1
The news is this and now another American athlete that is suing because she wasn't called by her non-binary pronouns by sportscasters. Ridiculous. The US is becoming a laughing stock.,1
quitters lose and losers quit,1
Why is this lady still making headlines?,1
Why even go with the team if shes not playing?,1
"Why she is still there??? Girl, pack up and come back and work on your issues ",1
It is better to send her home smh!,1
"Biles: ""Boo hoo. Poor me. I guess all that partying and less time training wasn't a good idea after all. Better pull out the trending ""mental-health-issue"" excuse. The public always falls for it"".",1
"She's afraid of loosing, let her go home",1
Wah wah pay attention to poor me. Why are we still hearing about this quitter who only showed up for the free vacation and publicity. ,1
LET HER HAVE HER MEDS.,1
Her Sponsors must be paying her by Screen time.....Go Home…,1
Maybe she s scare of drug test ?,1
The biggest scam of the Olympics.,1
Withdraw all events for your own sake,1
She's done. Finished.,1
Can I take her spot? Im very flexible.,1
"Keep on Simon Biles, The Whole world is on your side. May God bless you.",0
You are an intelligent talented woman. Strong 💪🏽 we love you Simone.,0
Simone praying for your wellness a d return.,0
"She is such a courageous and wonderful young woman. She conquered childhood trauma early on, sexual assault, set new milestones for gymnastics, and paid attention to her inner voice.",0
Can someone tell me why it's mostly men who are calling her a coward etc.,1
another athlete who didn't qualify to represent the country because of her,1
At least have the decency to fake a broken leg and don’t screw the team because you’re sad.,1
That’s nice… I’m glad she can realize that she’ s a human being! 😂😂😂😂😂 she should realize she’s a Selfish person as well and that would just be icing in the cake! ,1
"the chicken way out, she took a spot from another athlete",1
Waste of taxpayers money..she could have remained back in the US instead to heading to Tokyo.,1
"Biles is no GOAT, she is a COWard",1
"You let others down, just selfish",1
How about he is an embarrassment for attempting to shame someone who is putting their mental health first! ,1
"I think what she does is incredibly brave. What an athlete, what courage and strength! I can not imagine the pressure and publicity. ",0
Good thing she’s not a mom because you don’t get to quit for a mental health break. ,1
She is a great athlete. She will always stand out. ,0
Simone you are still a champ in my books! The best all around! You are so admired by many!,0
Give this gal some breathing room. She is great if she never enters another competition. ,1
our amazing Simone. Keep reaching for the stars no matter what you do ,0
Her mental health was good enough to go stand on the podium with her team and receive a silver medal after quitting…,1
Who cares she is so over rated!!,1
Hold your heads high! Us team has everything to be proud of!,0
Oh.. there are other young ladies on the team? ,1
She’s not the greatest! She quit! ,1
GOAT quitter,1
Simone is horribly underscored yet unmatched.,1
I am not into this Bullcrap! She is overrated ! Not a thing to her!,1
"Boycotting, will not be cheering any crybaby kneelers…those that kneel should never have been on the Olympics team. ",1
How is that not “quitting”? She didn’t just wake up that day and suddenly had mental issues.,1
She was just embarrassed cause she was fuckinup. I don't believe that mental breakdown. If that's the way she felt then why even bother to compete and why hasn't she gone home to take care of her mental issue.,1
Next excuse will be she was sexually abused and could not concentrate 100%. Tom Brady is the GOAT. He didn’t quit on his teammates. S Biles did quit so there’s no way she’s the GOAT. ,1
Beta Biles! It’s not normal for Americans to quit!,1
Simone no explanation needed take care of yourself ,0
Maybe she just wanna smoke some weed 🤷🏻‍♂️,1
"Someone hand her a dictionary. Yeah, she quit.",1
"Man, how many times is ABC going to post about this? It's over, stop beating a dead horse and cover something more recent",1
She is washed up,1
I still think she got her feelings hurt when the Russian beat her....and she can not stand defeat...just like pro sports players....if their team is losing or they screwup...they play hurt to get out of the game!!,1
What's wrong Lebron? You start losing so you wanna quit?,1
For some reason I don’t understand why she’s giving up? She never gave up those commercial checks? Why now?,1
I sure hope she gives back all of the money her sponsors gave her over the past 4 years !!! QUITTERS ARE WEAK!!!,1
"If you can't ""emotionally"" handle the pressures of competing... don't. But don't expect others to empathize them quitting on a sport THEY chose to do. She stole a spot from a young lady that WANTED to compete. Quitting exists in only a handful of sports and even those feel that quitting is a shameful way to go out. All you praising her are a joke. Does she deserve to get roasted... 100% yes. Accept the consequences for the horrible decisions you make. Oh yeah... we dont have to in this new world.",1
just quit,1
"She is not from spring, she is from sugar land ",1
She a quiter and an embarrassment,1
If she had issues she should have bowed out and let someone else take her place. I hope she didn’t get paid to drop out..,1
"Sound like a quitter to me.. life's rough you don't quit because you're stressed, you move forward and make it happen..",1
She just quit the individuals... loser... disgraceful.,1
I think she doing all this on purpose so much for being the GOAT,1
"Unpopular opinion not her first time at this level of competition, she knew what she was signing up for. She should be sent home at this point.",1
"This is the new trend. “Give Up” no more perseverance. No more work ethic. This is the message that will be sent to all the weak minded. Life is hard… so just quit. She is not the first this year to do this, she is just following in kind. All that hard work put in to something, just to quit. The Olympics are every 4 years. This was not a 9-5 job, but you can bet there will be MANY 9-5 and others to adopt this mentality. Just quit when you feel it is too hard. God Bless the U.S. where this can freely be a way of life….just quit",1
Nobody Likes a Quitter,1
Like just go away Mental? lol Go away!!,1
Maybe they should have made the coach go and pull her like they do pitchers in baseball when they aren’t peak performing then all the armchair gymnasts wouldn’t be complaining. ,1
She gave this country so much! Thank her and let her BE!!!,0
"What ever ,she getting more attention from this,than she could from winning a gold medal",1
"Simone, you need to take care of you. The country is so proud of you!",0
All of these armchair athletes bashing her are just pathetic,1
"She did what was best for her mental health,a very brave girl deserving our respect.",0
"Yes Baby girl, let them win their own medals without you Sis. You have nothing to prove ever again ALREADY a LEGEND",0
"Thanks for taking care of yourself first, it the best decision you made. Self care!",0
She is already a gold medalist. She is already the best! Let her make her own decisions!,0
"Simone Biles owes non of these jerk offs anything. She owes herself everything, take of you, Simone",0
Simone refused to help the team win gold that's very selfish why did she even went to Olympic trials again super selfish,1
Simone got scared of the Russians and that's exactly what happened she was embarrassed to compete against Russians and lose what a selfish person she picked up whatever excuse not to compete against the Russians that is so strange something unheard of let's hope she retires gymnastics cuz the national team don't need Simone anymore,1
Simone you made the right decision always go back and get your team What a Lady you are,0
That’s an excuse because the competition was better than her and she knew it. She doesn’t want to lose. ,1
She took someone's spot that could have been there and competed,1
She quit and that's all it is. Thanks for being a wannabe.,1
"What a quitter. Doesn't win, so she cries ""mental health"" and quits, letting down not only her entire team, but her entire country. Someone else deserved to have gone in her place. Someone who would have thoroughly represented the U.S. in a proud manner. Not like she did with her whiny ways.",1
SHE IS NO GOAT THE REAL GOATS MAKE NO EXCUSES THEY JUST GET IT DONE,1
Find her a quiet cry room.,1
She quit because a bad score broke her mind.🤦🏻‍♂️,1
She is magnificent! Thank you for representing our country well. Stay safe and healthy!,0
"She is a Quitter. She failed her team, her city, her state, and her country. She choked.. She will go down in history as one of the worst quitters ever.",1
"What a shame for the woman who just missed the cut,and was mentally ready to compete. ",1
Getting tired of these whiny athletes saying that stress is too much. ,1
"I can't help but wonder if anyone else feels like this mental health bs is a cop-out for an embarrassing performance? And yes, I am fully aware that I have zero athletic talent or ability so I'm not trying to be critical.",1
Mary lou Retton was the goat... a goat isn’t bronze,1
Stop idolizing her. Enough is enough,1
Disgraceful to quit,1
All of a sudden she’s ok ? Haha QUITTER,1
Had the try and steal the spot light from the white athlete who won gold. And it back fired good they shouldn't have let her compete,1
Simone Biles has represented the U.S. with style and grace in multiple contests. She deserves the benefit of the doubt in her current travails. Congratulations on a well-deserved medal. ,0
"I’m so glad that Simone Biles fought hard to overcome her twisties. It’s a good win! Congratulations to all the winners! Medal or without medal, all Olympic athletes are winners to me!",0
"So happy for you Simone! Way to overcome, re-adjust, and reset healthy expectations. Congrats also to all the athletes who worked so hard...whether or not they're wearing a medal this time. ",0
"Congratulations ladies, beam is a difficult event. Glad Simone was able to give this one a go, and a bronze medal is testimony to her inner strength.Way to go.!",0
"She only got a bronze medal. Well it turns out my original post that Simone did not have mental illness or the twisties, but was simply out of practice and rusty, was correct. She realized early on that she was not going to gold medal for any of the events because of lack of preparation and she made up those excuses to the gullible media and public.",1
"Looking at the Chinese girls, I'm just thinking that coming from a communist country they didn't have the same choices that Simone had, even if they may have had a breakdown. It is to appreciate the opportunity and recognition it is given to mental health. Good job, Simone! I hope you'll be an example to other athletes in the industry, no matter their origin country.",1
Simone Biles is gold by herself! Simone is our golden girl forever!,0
The headline should have read chinese athlethe won gold by beating American Simon Biles who successfully overcame her mental health issues by winning bronze.,1
The GOAT in more ways than one! The US is proud of you Simone! ,0
Never give up Simone Biles. It was your choice to make and USA supported your decision.,0
You all got suckered right in. She has been the story the whole time. Taking the spotlight from her more deserving teammates. Now we ruined calls her courageous and her brand blows up. Sounds like a marketing ploy to me,1
The USOC shouldn't have allowed Biles to compete. I don't care what her excuse was for the other events but to cherry pick one is totally wrong. ,1
"It don’t matter which one she won, it takes a champ to make it that far!!",0
So proud of the athletes that dealt with issues and still competed. ,0
Cheap Biles giving China more of a lead on the gold medal race,1
