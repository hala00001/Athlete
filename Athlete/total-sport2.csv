Did we forget what real heroes look like? Where is the face of the girl who didn’t quit and won Gold ,1
She should smoke some weed to calm her mind and be mentality relaxed with all the weight of the world on her shoulders.,1
We are missing a lot about other Olympic athletes/players enough of the Simone stuffs,1
She should have stayed home,1
Just sent her home!! She is scared as hell to compete,1
This is Olympic not Simone game,1
The news is this and now another American athlete that is suing because she wasn't called by her non-binary pronouns by sportscasters. Ridiculous. The US is becoming a laughing stock.,1
quitters lose and losers quit,1
Why is this lady still making headlines?,1
Why even go with the team if shes not playing?,1
"Why she is still there??? Girl, pack up and come back and work on your issues ",1
It is better to send her home smh!,1
"Biles: ""Boo hoo. Poor me. I guess all that partying and less time training wasn't a good idea after all. Better pull out the trending ""mental-health-issue"" excuse. The public always falls for it"".",1
"She's afraid of loosing, let her go home",1
Wah wah pay attention to poor me. Why are we still hearing about this quitter who only showed up for the free vacation and publicity. ,1
LET HER HAVE HER MEDS.,1
Her Sponsors must be paying her by Screen time.....Go Home…,1
Maybe she s scare of drug test ?,1
The biggest scam of the Olympics.,1
Withdraw all events for your own sake,1
She's done. Finished.,1
Can I take her spot? Im very flexible.,1
"Keep on Simon Biles, The Whole world is on your side. May God bless you.",0
You are an intelligent talented woman. Strong 💪🏽 we love you Simone.,0
Simone praying for your wellness a d return.,0
"She is such a courageous and wonderful young woman. She conquered childhood trauma early on, sexual assault, set new milestones for gymnastics, and paid attention to her inner voice.",0
Can someone tell me why it's mostly men who are calling her a coward etc.,1
another athlete who didn't qualify to represent the country because of her,1
At least have the decency to fake a broken leg and don’t screw the team because you’re sad.,1
That’s nice… I’m glad she can realize that she’ s a human being! 😂😂😂😂😂 she should realize she’s a Selfish person as well and that would just be icing in the cake! ,1
"the chicken way out, she took a spot from another athlete",1
Waste of taxpayers money..she could have remained back in the US instead to heading to Tokyo.,1
"Biles is no GOAT, she is a COWard",1
"You let others down, just selfish",1
How about he is an embarrassment for attempting to shame someone who is putting their mental health first! ,1
"I think what she does is incredibly brave. What an athlete, what courage and strength! I can not imagine the pressure and publicity. ",0
Good thing she’s not a mom because you don’t get to quit for a mental health break. ,1
She is a great athlete. She will always stand out. ,0
Simone you are still a champ in my books! The best all around! You are so admired by many!,0
Give this gal some breathing room. She is great if she never enters another competition. ,1
our amazing Simone. Keep reaching for the stars no matter what you do ,0
Her mental health was good enough to go stand on the podium with her team and receive a silver medal after quitting…,1
Who cares she is so over rated!!,1
Hold your heads high! Us team has everything to be proud of!,0
Oh.. there are other young ladies on the team? ,1
She’s not the greatest! She quit! ,1
GOAT quitter,1
Simone is horribly underscored yet unmatched.,1
I am not into this Bullcrap! She is overrated ! Not a thing to her!,1
"Boycotting, will not be cheering any crybaby kneelers…those that kneel should never have been on the Olympics team. ",1
How is that not “quitting”? She didn’t just wake up that day and suddenly had mental issues.,1
She was just embarrassed cause she was fuckinup. I don't believe that mental breakdown. If that's the way she felt then why even bother to compete and why hasn't she gone home to take care of her mental issue.,1
Next excuse will be she was sexually abused and could not concentrate 100%. Tom Brady is the GOAT. He didn’t quit on his teammates. S Biles did quit so there’s no way she’s the GOAT. ,1
Beta Biles! It’s not normal for Americans to quit!,1
Simone no explanation needed take care of yourself ,0
Maybe she just wanna smoke some weed 🤷🏻‍♂️,1
"Someone hand her a dictionary. Yeah, she quit.",1
"Man, how many times is ABC going to post about this? It's over, stop beating a dead horse and cover something more recent",1
She is washed up,1
I still think she got her feelings hurt when the Russian beat her....and she can not stand defeat...just like pro sports players....if their team is losing or they screwup...they play hurt to get out of the game!!,1
What's wrong Lebron? You start losing so you wanna quit?,1
For some reason I don’t understand why she’s giving up? She never gave up those commercial checks? Why now?,1
I sure hope she gives back all of the money her sponsors gave her over the past 4 years !!! QUITTERS ARE WEAK!!!,1
"If you can't ""emotionally"" handle the pressures of competing... don't. But don't expect others to empathize them quitting on a sport THEY chose to do. She stole a spot from a young lady that WANTED to compete. Quitting exists in only a handful of sports and even those feel that quitting is a shameful way to go out. All you praising her are a joke. Does she deserve to get roasted... 100% yes. Accept the consequences for the horrible decisions you make. Oh yeah... we dont have to in this new world.",1
just quit,1
"She is not from spring, she is from sugar land ",1
She a quiter and an embarrassment,1
If she had issues she should have bowed out and let someone else take her place. I hope she didn’t get paid to drop out..,1
"Sound like a quitter to me.. life's rough you don't quit because you're stressed, you move forward and make it happen..",1
She just quit the individuals... loser... disgraceful.,1
I think she doing all this on purpose so much for being the GOAT,1
"Unpopular opinion not her first time at this level of competition, she knew what she was signing up for. She should be sent home at this point.",1
"This is the new trend. “Give Up” no more perseverance. No more work ethic. This is the message that will be sent to all the weak minded. Life is hard… so just quit. She is not the first this year to do this, she is just following in kind. All that hard work put in to something, just to quit. The Olympics are every 4 years. This was not a 9-5 job, but you can bet there will be MANY 9-5 and others to adopt this mentality. Just quit when you feel it is too hard. God Bless the U.S. where this can freely be a way of life….just quit",1
Nobody Likes a Quitter,1
Like just go away Mental? lol Go away!!,1
Maybe they should have made the coach go and pull her like they do pitchers in baseball when they aren’t peak performing then all the armchair gymnasts wouldn’t be complaining. ,1
She gave this country so much! Thank her and let her BE!!!,0
"What ever ,she getting more attention from this,than she could from winning a gold medal",1
"Simone, you need to take care of you. The country is so proud of you!",0
All of these armchair athletes bashing her are just pathetic,1
"She did what was best for her mental health,a very brave girl deserving our respect.",0
"Yes Baby girl, let them win their own medals without you Sis. You have nothing to prove ever again ALREADY a LEGEND",0
"Thanks for taking care of yourself first, it the best decision you made. Self care!",0
She is already a gold medalist. She is already the best! Let her make her own decisions!,0
"Simone Biles owes non of these jerk offs anything. She owes herself everything, take of you, Simone",0
Simone refused to help the team win gold that's very selfish why did she even went to Olympic trials again super selfish,1
Simone got scared of the Russians and that's exactly what happened she was embarrassed to compete against Russians and lose what a selfish person she picked up whatever excuse not to compete against the Russians that is so strange something unheard of let's hope she retires gymnastics cuz the national team don't need Simone anymore,1
Simone you made the right decision always go back and get your team What a Lady you are,0
That’s an excuse because the competition was better than her and she knew it. She doesn’t want to lose. ,1
She took someone's spot that could have been there and competed,1
She quit and that's all it is. Thanks for being a wannabe.,1
"What a quitter. Doesn't win, so she cries ""mental health"" and quits, letting down not only her entire team, but her entire country. Someone else deserved to have gone in her place. Someone who would have thoroughly represented the U.S. in a proud manner. Not like she did with her whiny ways.",1
SHE IS NO GOAT THE REAL GOATS MAKE NO EXCUSES THEY JUST GET IT DONE,1
Find her a quiet cry room.,1
She quit because a bad score broke her mind.🤦🏻‍♂️,1
She is magnificent! Thank you for representing our country well. Stay safe and healthy!,0
"She is a Quitter. She failed her team, her city, her state, and her country. She choked.. She will go down in history as one of the worst quitters ever.",1
"What a shame for the woman who just missed the cut,and was mentally ready to compete. ",1
Getting tired of these whiny athletes saying that stress is too much. ,1
"I can't help but wonder if anyone else feels like this mental health bs is a cop-out for an embarrassing performance? And yes, I am fully aware that I have zero athletic talent or ability so I'm not trying to be critical.",1
Mary lou Retton was the goat... a goat isn’t bronze,1
Stop idolizing her. Enough is enough,1
Disgraceful to quit,1
All of a sudden she’s ok ? Haha QUITTER,1
Had the try and steal the spot light from the white athlete who won gold. And it back fired good they shouldn't have let her compete,1
Simone Biles has represented the U.S. with style and grace in multiple contests. She deserves the benefit of the doubt in her current travails. Congratulations on a well-deserved medal. ,0
"I’m so glad that Simone Biles fought hard to overcome her twisties. It’s a good win! Congratulations to all the winners! Medal or without medal, all Olympic athletes are winners to me!",0
"So happy for you Simone! Way to overcome, re-adjust, and reset healthy expectations. Congrats also to all the athletes who worked so hard...whether or not they're wearing a medal this time. ",0
"Congratulations ladies, beam is a difficult event. Glad Simone was able to give this one a go, and a bronze medal is testimony to her inner strength.Way to go.!",0
"She only got a bronze medal. Well it turns out my original post that Simone did not have mental illness or the twisties, but was simply out of practice and rusty, was correct. She realized early on that she was not going to gold medal for any of the events because of lack of preparation and she made up those excuses to the gullible media and public.",1
"Looking at the Chinese girls, I'm just thinking that coming from a communist country they didn't have the same choices that Simone had, even if they may have had a breakdown. It is to appreciate the opportunity and recognition it is given to mental health. Good job, Simone! I hope you'll be an example to other athletes in the industry, no matter their origin country.",1
Simone Biles is gold by herself! Simone is our golden girl forever!,0
The headline should have read chinese athlethe won gold by beating American Simon Biles who successfully overcame her mental health issues by winning bronze.,1
The GOAT in more ways than one! The US is proud of you Simone! ,0
Never give up Simone Biles. It was your choice to make and USA supported your decision.,0
You all got suckered right in. She has been the story the whole time. Taking the spotlight from her more deserving teammates. Now we ruined calls her courageous and her brand blows up. Sounds like a marketing ploy to me,1
The USOC shouldn't have allowed Biles to compete. I don't care what her excuse was for the other events but to cherry pick one is totally wrong. ,1
"It don’t matter which one she won, it takes a champ to make it that far!!",0
So proud of the athletes that dealt with issues and still competed. ,0
Cheap Biles giving China more of a lead on the gold medal race,1
"Regardless of the state and politics, how does Saudi Arabia send an athlete at this disappointing level?",1
"The Saudi girl is young and she was subjected to great media, political and religious pressure,, very few experienced people who can overcome this pressure, and the girl is still young at the beginning of her career and this is her first test and she will develop with time.",0
"fuck her, and everything supports such a thing, and everything supports such things, which are innocent of Islam.",1
"If she withdrew, she would have left, at least with her dignity",0
Thank God she was defeated and lost the contest,0
"How dare she plays with a Zionism player, if she withdraws, would be the best.  The result would have been known in advance. What a pride. Shame on her playing with uncovered hair and pants in the era of decadence, if you are not ashamed, do what you want",1
Far from normalization and surrender to Israel..... the Israeli player was manipulating her as if she was... a doll... paralyzed... an inflated airbag.... The match is humiliating and the result is scandalous,1
"Girl, your level is very weak. Why do you compete with Zionism stronger than you? you even did not win an honorable position, or not even in sports??",1
"If she refused to play with Zionism, it would have been more honorable to her than this scandal",1
Loser,1
My message to Tahani Al-Qahtani..lose weight.  Pray rather than play. Pray and ask forgiveness and stay in the kitchen..Take care of your studies..Leave sports to its people. The entire Saudi players are failures and embarrassed us with a shameful appearance..,1
"Haha, she failed herself and took off her hijab. The last thing was her face smashed by the Jewish player. feel sad about  the millions who spend on these people ",1
"not only, she normalized with Israel, but she also removed the hejab. Akhkhkh shame Akhkhkh",1
 shame  in all areas and that's it only,1
She lost twice: once because she accepted to play with Israel player  and once in the arena,1
God humiliated her and she  humiliated his country,1
"We are not proud of those who removed their hijab and chastity, women who lost their modesty and were trampled on by a Jew, O God, do not gloat, with the black of the face.",1
The poor woman removed her hijab for nothing and lost.,1
"I hope she withdrew, this is embarrassing frankly, ""I don't see a player who plays in this tournament, this is how they play in the streets.""",1
"She was wearing a hijab, then took off her hijab and played a game with the player of the Zionist entity and lost 11-0. This is the fate of those who sell their religion for the sake of this world",1
Poor participation.. in the Olympics.. indicates the lack of seriousness in the first place in appearing in an honorable manner for the country..,0
"If she withdrew, it would have been more honorable for her, but the one who is humiliated is humiliated",1
failed level. she failed us God fails her forever.,1
is who faced a Zionism man or a girl ?,1
This is the benefit of fast food 😂😂😂😂..,0
"She took off her hijab and took off her believes, so God insulted her with those who sent her",1
"I mean, you did not beat the Zionist and cheer up our hearts And you did not withdraw and come out with pride#Tahani_Al-QahtaniTo the darkest day of history..",1
"A scandal..normalization..a loss of employment..In addition to all of this, it took severe beatings and a humiliating loss..you deserve it",1
"Normalization, ruthlessness, and on top of that the loss",1
"if she withdrew would be better for her, gain the satisfaction of God and then the satisfaction of the Arab peoples",0
"Tahani the camel deserves to lose, unless she is forced by the normalization of relations with israel. May God forgive her because she has not only lost this match, but has tarnished the honor of every Saudi and Saudi by removing her hijab, Who are you?",1
If she helps her mother in the kitchen would be better for her than this defeat,1
"She lost her religion and honor, and she insulted  by both Arabs and Jews",1
"You didn't withdraw with honor, so you lost with humiliation ",1
"She takes off the hejab  and dyes her hair from the color of goats to the color of guinea pigs, and Zionism crushes her . she is  is air(nothing ) in front of the Zionists. If you face your enemy, you either crush him and be an Olympic champion or withdraw and be a national hero. Her tears mean nothing but sorry for the shame. Go to hell",1
Selling honor is cheaper than buying it,0
"The hardest thing in the matter is Tahani became the embodiment of humiliation, shame and athletic weakness 11-0... She was weak in the fight, so she lost athletically and lost the honor of a homeland.. She accepted that Zionism gave up and humiliated herself and put the flag of her country side by side with the flag of the Zionists, so she lost the honor of a nation and Manasra lost a human cause, and in the end, I do not know which water or which sanitizer this will cleanse her hands, which shook hands with the representative of the criminal Zionists, the killers of children, the germ that will destroy peace on earth to please and in the hope of sending their savior to rule the world...hell to the Arabs from an evil that has approached",1
You like normalization with israel like Tahani. you feel sympathize with her it is humiliation,1
The men quit because they knew they were gonna lose.  Rather than going out fighting they went out on their knees as cowards.  Good to see the Saudi Arabian judoka not quit.,0
You really think world class athletes would forfeit a match after intense training and preparation because they were scared?? They made sacrifices for cause much bigger than sport. No athlete wants to have to forfeit a match. But it’s the right thing to do.,0
"coming is more beautiful and strong, God willing",0
you did your best ,0
we are proud of you Tahani,0
"It is enough for us to be proud of trying,,,",0
"The young heroine, Tahani Al-Qahtani, is 21 years old. We say congratulations on confrontational courage. Heroes are born in such conditions. Waiting for honorable results in the next Paris Olympics.",0
"The promise is at of Paris, TOTE, my sweet, you honored us by trying, my hero",0
"She didn't fall short, and God willing, she will make up for it next time. Her competition is not easy",0
"Hard luck and the next is more beautiful, God willing",0
"This is the first step, and the next one is better",0
"we are proud of you. You represented your country with all the honor and courage .  You did not follow the path of withdrawal like others. We wish you success and success in the rest of your career, a white heart, a white heart, the flag of Saudi Arabia.",0
"God willing, the upcoming courses will honor us and raise the name of our country and participants. We are proud that they continued and did not withdraw like others. Honor is the attempt, not fear and withdrawal.",0
"In order to find Olympic champions, we must first be aware of the hours of training for the first-level teams. The time of talented people in various sports must be freed up and the number of training hours should be increased for them with special programs.",0
"In order to find heroes, we need to prepare for it and prepare for it in advance not right away before participating",0
"All the best, sports are either win or  lose And we are proud of your participation",0
"Good luck,Tahani  , it's better to forget this match, and even if you lose, it is enough for the honor to try",0
"Good luck Tahani .. Your participation is certainly honorable and there is no doubt about that.. Three years of sports that means  you are still in the beginning and you have a long sports career ahead, and God willing, it will be full of successes and achievements.",0
"She is still at the beginning of her sports career, and in her participation, she did her best. The road ahead is long for improvement and development, God willing.",0
"God willing, in the 2024 Paris Olympics, you will train more and win.",0
It is ok the best will coming soon. The only positive thing about this Olympics was shown by the Saudi public and it ignites enthusiasm and hope for the upcoming participation. It is a project of a new generation and diversity in sports.,0
"I said it and I say it again, I mean the amount of pressure on a novice athlete that even a professional who has years of experience can't bear, so how about Tahani who just started? The important thing here is that you were encouraged and did not succumb to any pressures and complimented you with your participation and the loss is possible even for the most powerful professionals and the future is in front of you. Do not give up, proud of you",0
"You did your best Tahani. The presence of Saudi women is very important, and this is only the beginning. Congratulations, ",0
"We are crying because you lost a match !! it makes no sense to be sad because sport is a win or loss, but I am happy that I see my country’s daughters have global participation in the Olympics like any country..I am optimistic about a strong future for my Tahani  Al-Qahtani and I am certain that one day she will get a gold medal in one of the upcoming Olympics.",0
The goal is to learn and challenge yourself to achieve the best in the future. Loss is the beginning of a stage of success,0
Appreciate this act by both the players. Very happy to see both Saudi Arabia and Israel expressing the spirit of Olympics. ,0
Great to hear the coach encourage the fighter to hug her opponent and raise her hand. Fantastic sportsmanship,0
"Wonderful to see sport providing an opportunity to build relationships, respect and mutual understanding. Both contestants are winners. Friendship between people, nations and cultures is above politics.",0
m so love and so touch with there gestured,0
Now if the republicans and democrats can do that!,0
"Yesterday , in the international friendship day, it was also historic for the relations of Israel with the arab world . Except of fighting when it is needed also with the help of SWU We are happy to connect with ",0
OMG look at those black belt ,0
Hand shake of shame with occupation. Filthy,1
You are the one to be shamed. This sport and not politic. Hate will kill us and our children all. The world needs peace and not hatred.,0
Truly stunning and brave ,0
Pure class from both athletes.,0
"if you watch it through twice, it looks as though she bows, shakes her hand and then throws her over her shoulder......",0
"Sport is supposed to be apolitical, tolerant of everyone and represent the best of the competitive spirit, but everywhere the Fundamentalist Islam haters operate, they degrade and demean whatever it is they participate in. This young woman represents the best humanity has to offer and I hope she doesn't get ""chastized"" by some xenophobic,anti-semitic mysognist in her home country because she didn't tow the party line!",0
Beat the devil? Seriously? Those hateful fools need to get a life.,1
"Humiliating Defeat!! Not only the Saudi athlete, Tahani Al-Qahtani, refused to heed the Palestinian call not to play with an Israeli Player on the footsteps of Algerian and Sudanese judokas, but she also suffered a humiliating Defeat (0-11).",0
"Poor athlete Tahani is a victim , the defeat is not on her but on those officials who forced her to accept the bout",0
Great to see the amazing sportsmanship between Tahani al-Qahtani and Raz Hershko in the Olympic judo. Small gestures that will do more to heal relations between troubled countries than refusing to play each other ever will ,0
Events at the Olympics show how far the region has come but also how far it has to go in terms of engagement with Israel and Israelis. Bravo Tahani al-Qahtani!,0
"Since i'm from west,and don't of course properly understand other cultures: I assume this was the first in a long time,do you think it played a role that it was women?Was it easier to accept a defeat toFlag of Israel because of the gender, would it have been politically harder if it was men?",0
"Man or women, none should have played even if winning was guaranteed because it's a principle. Do not normalize with Israel even in sports. That's the whole point.",1
The Saudi looks really happy...I wonder why...,0
Beautiful handshake and hug between two remarkable athletes from Israel Flag of Israel and Saudi Arabia Flag of Saudi Arabia. They are both winners and an inspiration ,0
"Congratulations to the Israeli player Raz Hare ShakouI send you to the heroine, Tahani Al-Qahtani, and I tell you that you have made history.Thank you to the Israeli brothers for their sportsmanship, and the next one between us will be better I also hope for a football match",0
I am very proud of Yasmine Al-Dabbagh and Tahani Al-Qahtani for representing Saudi women in sports at the Olympics ,0
"I find in unconvincing that Tahani Al-Qahtani was “instructed” by the #Saudi government to withdraw AND, she would defy that instruction. The Saudi Minister of Sport (Abdulaziz bin Turki) was right there before her bout She may have lost the bout, but all of Saudi is proud of  her",0
"#Saudi Judo player Tahani Al-Qahtani refused to withdraw, as instructed by her gov., from the competition in Tokyo Olympics when she was facing an Israeli player, as has been the case with most of the Arab players. Anyway, she lost the game against the Israeli player minutes ago",0
Correction: judo player refused to run away from confrontation or give a Zionist a free win. I loath the apartheid ethic cleansing regime but I don’t want to give them an automatic win.,0
Her government has been dealing with the Israelis and secretly negotiating a peaceful treaty (like the Emirate). I find it difficult that she disobeyed her government order.I am glad she lost.,0
"Big liar ! How did you know that her gov. Instructed her to not withdraw!!! Have a evidence? Secondly not most Arabs withdraw like Egypt , Jordan , Morocco and Tunis.For me I don’t want any Arab or Muslim play against them but don’t say lies plz",0
"My weekend is so eventful, we're promised so much fun by Mohammed Abdu's concert tonight and Tahani Al-Qahtani's judo match tomorrow all support and love for both of them to perform very well ❤",0
It's a sport you win or lose  Tahani Al-Qahtani is a pioneer in our sport for ladies in our country  We didn't expect her to win for the first time but we should build for the future We are proud of her if she win or lose,0
Great performance from one side.. tahani should have done the math and realised the opponents served in the army where tactics are quite different on the ground and in the discipline of what her trainers taught.,0
"Saudi judoka participating in the Tokyo Olympics 2021Tahani decided not to withdraw in front of an Israeli playerTahani lost 0-11Tahani played without her hijabTahani lost the respect of the Arab and Islamic world, and above her she lost the match",1
"I'm seeing a lot of gloating about Tahani al-Qahtani of #SaudiArabia losing to #Israel's Raz Hershko in #Judo. I don't care what your politics are, when you have the balls to face an opponent in combat, sports or otherwise, then you can have an opinion. Until then, shut up.",0
"It really is disgraceful seeing the amount of cackling hyenas who couldn't fight to save their lives having a go. At least she had the courage to compete, show some respect.",0
"Actually a goal was achieved here, after Algerian athletes refused to face an Israeli",0
Best of luck to Al-Qahtani and the boys and girls of my country in the upcoming Olympics and world competitions in the future The dogs bark and the caravan moves forward ,0
"Is this not considered normalization, O Palestinians?",0
"We did not see your barking at the presence of Qatari fans in Israel, nor at the presence of the Qatari team, Paris Saint-Germain, in Israel, as you did when Tahani Al-Qahtani confronted her Israeli counterpart ...",1
"congratulate the Israeli people for their love and support for the girl, Tahani Al-Qahtani.",0
If I were her I wouldn't play and Drew back from the competition even if I am sure that I will win,0
Great job competing! She is a strong woman not to chicken out for fear of losing. Winning isn't everything. Tawaqal ala Allah. We are so proud of her!!!,0
she should have stayed home and spared everyone the embarassment.,0
"I don't know what Ur problem is, making Jewish Hate tweets. Israel is where Jews were from! Israel has as much right as any other Country there. Before there was no Jordan, no Syria, no Lebanon, no Saudi Arabia. Why U pick on Israel.Large blue diamond",0
Historic moment: our Judo athlete Tahani Al-qahtani who’s scheduled to face off with Israel’s Raz at the elimination round of 32 of the Judo competition in #TokyoOlympics2020 is TODAY. literally i have NEVER been so proud of a stranger the way im proud of her,0
Saudis should be smarter. Withdrawing could let them winning back hearts of Arabs.,0
Stupid decision and will affect Tahani's career.,1
"Lina is anti-Semitic and demands the contestant, Tahani Al-Qahtani, to withdraw from facing the Israeli player.  Here, the demands of the opponents abroad become clear to us, which is the policy of isolation between countries",0
My utmost respect to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and her people.,0
Really? Who pressured Saudi judoka Tahani al-Qahtani to drop out of the match? Not what Israel would have expected from Saudi Arabia today.,0
"This is what the Olympic games is all about, politics shouldn’t have a place in the games. Respect to Tahani Al-Qatani",0
This is not about politics. But your point still stands.Kudos to all involved in this exchange of peace.,0
"So many people in Twitter tried to tell the baseball teams to boycott playing Israel Face with tears of joy. Tf, we’re gonna play them no matter what.",0
We have to choose peace not hatred.,0
"We Pakistani still boycott you, only country who proudly deny any relation with occupiers, the killers of innocent #Palestinian, children and women. I'm proud to have a passport that says ""THIS PASSPORT IS VALID FOR ALL COUNTRIES OF THE WORLD EXCEPT ISRAEL.""",1
Children are among Palestinians martyred in the latest Israeli airstrikes on Gaza. How convenient it is for the world to process the killing of innocent Palestinians! Criminal silence is akin to condoning Israeli war crimes. Are you on side of humanity or terrorism?,1
"This is the first post and it is the beginning of future posts And the loss is expected, but withdrawing is a foolish decision, as this is a sport, not a policy",0
Muslims are such savages that the world praises them just for acting normal.,1
When I saw both of their pictures I knew Israel would win. The Israeli chick has eyes of a Pitbull. No way the Saudi Labrador would win.,1
"We don't need racists and fanatics at the Olympics, they already destroy our daily life where ever we live.",0
Saudis are never extremists and hateful they are educated and respect women..,0
"Of course, you do not care about Palestine because Israel does not persecute your nation and your race with international support. You certainly do not care.",1
Saudi Arabia encouraged her to stay in as did most of the country. It was outside pressure. Read the article.,0
"Good way to embarrass yourself and the country, great job",1
"A total stunt, he can lift 285kg but couldn't defeat women here, just so they can ""confirm"" trangenders don't have advantage against women.",1
So a man fails in women’s competition,1
"Well of course he's gonna make history. No man has ever faced a woman in the Olympics! Not just history, making a mockery of the Olympics",1

"Keep encouraging madness. His skeletal structure, muscle development are all male. Even if he has sexual reassignment surgery. You believe you are a woman no problem, you want to dress as a woman go right ahead but being allowed to compete as a woman is wrong. The women who have trained, some of them their whole lives to compete at this level don't deserve to be treated in this manner. It is not fair nor equitable to them.",1
"Is Laurel taking estrogen? Is Laurel's testosterone under the correct limits for women? Sorry if this sounds really crappy of me, but honestly I wonder if this is a joke.

What's next? Going to break a leg to qualify for the paralympics?,1

"It seems absurd that people get so emotionally invested in events that only happen once every four years and have literally no bearing on their lives whatsoever. Get out and do something useful, folks.",0
"Who cares, it's a sport not anything that contributes to every day life. Just be happy for everyone we dont have to agree but we should respect everyone.",0
"I’m all for equality and all…. So let’s just make a third group for the olympics. So there will be : Males, Females, and trans/non-binary group. Aka trans get their own group and compete against other trans members only",0
