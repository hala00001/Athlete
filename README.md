To compute the staking factor, apply the equation below:

$(1- (\frac{Max_{t}^{d} - (SP_{i,t}^{d} - SP_{i,t-1}^{d})}{Max_{t}^{d}})^{3})$

To compute user factor, apply the equation below:






One other work-around is to use jupyter notebooks and use the markdown mode in cells to render equations.

Basic stuff seems to work perfectly, like centered equations

\begin{equation}

$$(1-\frac{Max_{t}^{u} - \sum\limits _{v\in SP_{i,t}^{u}} UW(v, t))}{Max_{t}^{u}})$$
\end{equation}
